The BoulzyManagerBundle is a library aiming to help shaping the business logic of a Symfony application. Managers are
Symfony services used to manipulate an object (like business model objects) to centralize in one place the operations
that can be perform on them. Homogenizing them makes the interactions between different managers easier as well as
providing more confort for the developer. It also helps following the SOLID principles on the business logic part of the
application.
